The Public: I am always on the look out for the hip new coffee shop in town, and my biggest qualification for a good hip new spot is that it has blazing fast wifi speeds capable of downloading all my favorite new flicks to watch at home! This application has been incredibly useful for me because I am now able to look at what places near me have a good wifi signal for me to use. I have even been able to find places that don't require any payment to use their wifi. When I find a place that I really enjoy, I can even write up a quick review about the place and perhaps any things that I have. 


A Business: It had been really slow for my business until the last couple weeks when more people started suddenly showing up. I questioned one of the customers, and I found out that this new application WiFinder is showing my business with blazing fast internet speeds available to the public! Now I advertise how quick my wifi speeds are and it has increased my business tenfold. Hopefully in the future I can put in some money and purchase a sponsored spot on the application which will push my business to the top of local searches.
