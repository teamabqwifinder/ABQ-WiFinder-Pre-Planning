### User Story

    The Public: I am always on the look out for the hip new coffee shop in town, and my biggest qualification for a good hip new spot is that it has blazing fast wifi speeds capable of downloading all my favorite new flicks to watch at home! This application has been incredibly useful for me because I am now able to look at what places near me have a good wifi signal for me to use. I have even been able to find places that don't require any payment to use their wifi. When I find a place that I really enjoy, I can even write up a quick review about the place and perhaps any things that I have. 


    A Business: It had been really slow for my business until the last couple weeks when more people started suddenly showing up. I questioned one of the customers, and I found out that this new application WiFinder is showing my business with blazing fast internet speeds available to the public! Now I advertise how quick my wifi speeds are and it has increased my business tenfold. Hopefully in the future I can put in some money and purchase a sponsored spot on the application which will push my business to the top of local searches. 


### Required functional components

    A client application—an Android app, a Java SE application, web pages constructed dynamically on the server side using a templating or component approach, etc.

    An application server, usually in the form of a REST service provider.

    A database server—typically—but not necessarily—a MySQL or Derby database server. (Note that the application server and database server may reside on different hosts or the same host; they may even be embedded in a single program.)

    The inclusion of a back-end database (which is required) doesn't preclude the use of a database on the client side—e.g. a SQLite database on Android. In fact, your client implementation will still be expected to include some kind of persistent data store.

    Communication between the client application and server application. Typically, this will consist of one or more REST (or REST-like) services published by the server application, and consumed by the client application. These services should allow the client application to create, read, and update (and optionally delete) objects stored on the server side, in accordance with the business logic of the server side.

    Support for multiple simultaneous client application users, connected as relevant to the server application.

    Automated pre-loading of any relevant base data sets (client- and server-side).

    User authentication (this may—and often does—leverage the services of an OAuth2 provider, such as Google).
